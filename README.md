🚨 Vehicle Tracking Alarm Generator (Console Application)

A C# console application that generates custom alarms based on user-defined rules from a Vehicle Tracking System.
This lightweight tool runs continuously to monitor live or simulated vehicle data and trigger alerts (e.g., over-speeding, idling, unauthorized zone entry) when certain conditions are met.

------------------------------

🧭 Overview

The Vehicle Tracking Alarm Generator (Console App) is designed for automation and background processing.
It continuously reads data from a tracking source (e.g., API, file, or database), checks conditions defined by the user, and triggers alarms accordingly.
Ideal for server-side deployment or scheduled execution as part of a larger vehicle tracking solution.
